# Patient Management System

## Manage patient information easily!

**What will the application do?**

It will do the following:
- add, remove, update patients.
- keep and store a record  of the conditions of patients
- keep a record of the doctors the patient visited.

**Who will use it?**

The *hospital management team* will use it to keep track of patients
and store the necessary information for their next visit.


**Why is this project of interest to you?**

Being from Bangladesh, I saw how mismanagement of 
patients' information can be detrimental to the service of
the hospitals. As most of the management system is 
paper-based, a lot of important information including
 medical history of patients would be misplaced and lost.
  In the future, I hope to develop this application 
  further to solve these issues.
